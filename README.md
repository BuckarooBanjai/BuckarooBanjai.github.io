# Respect 

To Jacob Tomlinson for creating this awesome theme for blogging. All I did was to fork it and tailor it to my needs - essentially to create a Greek version of it for my blog. The fact that I am a Greek economist (which may be a joke or a nightmare these days...) with no programming or coding skills and was still able to customise it to my liking, is a testament of Jacob's work. Typography is a beauty - even with Greek characters and it has all the features you will ever need. So here I am, standing on the shoulders of giants... 

Cheers
